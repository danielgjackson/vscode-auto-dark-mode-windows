## Features

* Command *Toggle Theme* (`auto-dark-mode-windows.toggle`) with default hot-key `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Shift`+`T`, to toggle between light/dark theme.
* A small status bar icon to perform the theme switch.

This standard settings are used to customize the light/dark themes:

* `workbench.preferredDarkColorTheme` (default: *Default Dark+*)
* `workbench.preferredLightColorTheme` (default: *Default Light+*)

NOTE: If you would like to track the operating system's light/dark mode, use the VS Code setting `window.autoDetectColorScheme`.


## History

This extension was previously *Automatic Theme Switcher for Windows Dark Mode*, which automatically switched between dark/light themes to match Windows Dark Mode (and required *Windows 10 October 2018 Update* or later), and used the settings `autoDarkMode.darkTheme` and `autoDarkMode.lightTheme`.  The extension was partly inspired by a version for *macOS Mojave*: [auto-dark-mode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LinusU.auto-dark-mode&ssr=false).  However, since VS Code V1.42 (January 2020), a standard setting has been available: `window.autoDetectColorScheme` which performs that action in a cross-platform way.
